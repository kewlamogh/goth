An easy to use web authorization system for MongoDB.

Written 100% in Golang!
# Contributing
Feel free to add an issue, and if you have a fix, create a pull request. When developing, it is important that you create a `test_config.env` file. This environment file should contain the MongoDB uri - this is used for testing purposes, and the file is gitignored.

# Demo
You can find a barebones application in the `example` directory. Checkout the repo, add your uri to the .env file, and then run index.go.
